B.S., Environmental Health | Western Carolina University (2011)<br>

## Maintained Packages

**MCMetrics**:
A python package for calculating conditional performance metrics for machine learning models. In implicitly calculates Bayesian credible intervals for each metric, allowing for a more robust evaluation of model performance with small- and medium-sized datasets. Additionally, it provides a suite of tools for visualizing model performance, metric comparisons, and model selection. The package is designed to be user-friendly and a low-code solution.
